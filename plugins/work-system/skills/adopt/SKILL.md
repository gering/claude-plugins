# Adopt Existing Branch

> Bring an existing branch into the work system — create a worktree and task file for it

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Optional: branch name to adopt

## Critical: never persist a `cd` into the worktree

This skill runs **in the user's main-repo session**. It creates the worktree; the user enters it in a separate terminal/Claude session (see the final step).

The Bash tool persists CWD between calls — a bare `cd .claude/worktrees/<task>` would silently trap the entire session inside the worktree. Rules for every shell command:

- ❌ Never `cd <worktree>` standalone or as `cd <worktree> && …` without a paired `cd` back.
- ✅ Use `git -C <worktree-path> …` for git operations against the worktree.
- ✅ Use absolute paths or paths relative to the main repo for `cp`, `mkdir`, `ln -s`.
- ✅ If a different CWD is genuinely needed, wrap in a subshell: `(cd <worktree-path> && <cmd>)`.

## Instructions

1. **Check current location** (shared helper — robust against paths with spaces and symlinks):
   - Run: `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/main-repo-path.sh" linked` → `main` or `linked`.
     If `linked`, this is already a worktree — stop and explain this command should be run from
     the main repo.
   - Run: `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/main-repo-path.sh" path` → `<main-repo>` — capture
     it for the CWD-drift check in step 11.

2. **Select branch**:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` provided, use as branch name
   - Otherwise, list available branches:
     - Run: `git branch --list --no-merged | grep -v '^\*'`
     - Exclude the current branch and any `task/*` branches that already have worktrees
     - Show the list and ask the user which branch to adopt
   - Verify the branch exists: `git rev-parse --verify <branch-name>`

3. **Derive task name**:
   - Strip common prefixes (same set as the shared helper's `strip_prefix`): `task/`, `feature/`,
     `fix/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`
   - Convert to kebab-case if needed
   - Examples:
     - `feature/dark-mode` → `dark-mode`
     - `fix/calendar-date-bug` → `calendar-date-bug`
     - `my-feature` → `my-feature`
   - Show proposed task name and ask for confirmation

4. **Check for conflicts**:
   - Check if `tasks/<task-name>.md` already exists
   - Check if `task/<task-name>` branch already exists
   - Check if worktree path `.claude/worktrees/<task-name>` already exists
   - If any conflict, ask user how to proceed (rename or skip)

5. **Gather task context from branch**:
   - Detect main branch:
     - Run: `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'`
     - If that fails, check if `main` or `master` exists: `git branch --list main master`
   - Get commit history: `git log --oneline <main-branch>..<branch-name>`
   - Get changed files: `git diff --stat <main-branch>...<branch-name>`
   - Get diff summary: `git diff --shortstat <main-branch>...<branch-name>`

6. **Generate task file**:
   - Use the commit messages and changed files to draft a task file
   - Template:
     ```markdown
     # <Title derived from branch name and commits>

     ## Goal
     <Inferred from commit messages>

     ## Context
     Adopted from existing branch `<original-branch-name>`.

     ## Progress
     - [x] <Summary of work already done, based on commits>

     ## Remaining
     - [ ] <Any obvious remaining work, or "Review and finalize">

     ## Relevant Files
     - `<changed-file-1>`
     - `<changed-file-2>`
     ```
   - Show to user for review and allow edits

7. **Create task file**:
   - Write to: `tasks/<task-name>.md`
   - Create `tasks/` directory if it doesn't exist

8. **Rename branch** (optional):
   - Ask: "Rename branch `<original-name>` to `task/<task-name>`? (recommended for consistency)"
   - If yes: `git branch -m <original-name> task/<task-name>`
   - If no: keep original branch name and note it in the task file

9. **Create worktree**:
   - Create parent directory if needed: `mkdir -p .claude/worktrees`
   - Worktree path: `.claude/worktrees/<task-name>`
   - If branch was renamed: `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<task-name> task/<task-name>`
   - If branch kept original name: `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<task-name> <original-branch-name>`

10. **Copy files to worktree** (run from main-repo CWD — no `cd`):
    - Copy task file: `cp tasks/<task-name>.md .claude/worktrees/<task-name>/TASK.md`
    - Copy Claude config if present (a fresh worktree has no `.claude/` dir yet, so create it
      first — otherwise the copy silently no-ops):
      `[ -f .claude/settings.json ] && mkdir -p .claude/worktrees/<task-name>/.claude && cp .claude/settings.json .claude/worktrees/<task-name>/.claude/`

11. **Verify CWD is still in the main repo**:
    - Run: `pwd` and compare to the `<main-repo>` path captured by the helper in step 1.
    - If they differ, **stop and report an error**: "Session CWD drifted into the worktree during adopt — investigate which step ran a persistent `cd`." Do not silently continue.

12. **Final output for the user** (display this block — do *not* execute the `cd`):
    ```
    Branch adopted into work system!

    Original branch: <original-branch-name>
    Task file:       tasks/<task-name>.md
    Worktree:        .claude/worktrees/<task-name>
    Branch:          <current-branch-name>
    Commits:         <count> commits ahead of <main-branch>

    👉 To start working there, open a SEPARATE terminal (not this Claude
       session — this session stays in the main repo) and run:

         cd .claude/worktrees/<task-name>
         claude -n "<task-name>" "/continue"
    ```
    `-n "<task-name>"` names the session (shown in `/resume` and the terminal title);
    the `/continue` initial prompt runs the resume flow (load TASK.md, recent commits,
    progress) deterministically — both in one launch. Do **not** execute the `cd` yourself
    — it is for the user's new terminal.

## Remember

- The original branch is preserved — it's either renamed or checked out as-is
- The task file is a best-effort draft from commit history — the user should review it
- After adoption, the standard workflow applies: `/continue`, `/status`, `/close`
